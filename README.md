# solar_system_generator

This project was created for the Fall 2023 Truman State University ACM Hackathon that took place over a two-week span.

The end goal of the project was to create a solar system generator, which, as the name implies, is meant to generate a theoretically plausible solar system.

By the end of the hackathon, it was only able to generate most of the features of a star.

Known limitations at this time are:
- Does not generate any planets
- Does not support 3D space
- Cannot create binary star systems
- The maximum number of planets is 10
- Units are not displayed when using the Solar.printstar(::Star) function
